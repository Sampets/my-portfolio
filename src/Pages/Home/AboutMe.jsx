            From a young age, I was drawn to technology. My journey began in
            high school, where I dabbled in programming, creating simple
            algorithms that ignited my passion. This path led me to pursue a
            Computer Science degree at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. As
            a recent graduate, I've taken my initial strides as a Mobile
            Developer, but I'm eager to continue learning and achieving new
            milestones.

            My professional experience is mainly on the Unity Engine and Android
            Studio IDE, using C# and Java respectively. I have also dealt with
            Swift for iOS development and Vue.js for the occasional front-end
            details. On my personal projects, I code in Python as well.
